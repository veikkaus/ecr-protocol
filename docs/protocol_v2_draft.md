with identified instants
===============================================================================

Cash register system providers / developers

Introduction
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This document describes how to connect Veikkaus’ Elite-S betting terminal to a retailer’s cash register.

The data link between the betting terminal and the cash register is used to synchronize betting transactions between Veikkaus’ gaming systems and the agent’s POS systems without manual actions on the cash register. It is thus intended to reduce discrepancies between Veikkaus invoicing and the agent’s bookkeeping.

The first versions of this betting transaction interface were originally built into Veikkaus’ old “Altura” terminals. Alongside these, Veikkaus has operated old Fintoto’s “Wave” horse gaming terminals, which have their own method and protocol for providing transaction data to agents’ POS systems.

Veikkaus’ Elite-S betting terminal will provide the betting transaction interface described in this document. The protocol used in the interface includes some new transaction types, game types, and indexes.

In the future, Veikkaus aims to provide a server-based service for synchronizing gaming transactions between Veikkaus gaming systems and agents’ POS systems. The plan is to start developing this new type of service no later than after the new terminal rollout.


Asynchronous Serial Communication between Terminal and Cash Register
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Asynchronous serial communication is used for the transmission of data. The Elite-S retailer terminals will come equipped with serial ports complying with the RS-232 standard.

There is no multipoint capability for a single connection.


### Cables

DE-9 cables will be used for data transfer.

Serial port connectors mounted on terminal are male. Most serial port connectors mounted on cash registers are also male.

Veikkaus´ Elite-S betting terminal connector is type D-9 female. PC end connector is usually D-9 female for serial port. Signal wires must ‘cross connected’. 
Cable connections are: 
D-9  D9 
2 3 
3 2 
4 4 
5 5 
6 6

Communication Protocol
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The betting terminal transmits messages that the cash register reads. Messages from the terminal do not need to be acknowledged.

- Messages are ASCII strings
- Messages start with a colon character (`:`)
- Fields within the message are separated by semicolon characters (`;`)
- Messages are terminated by carriage return and line feed characters (`\r\n`)

Connection configuration in asynchronous mode (a serial port parameter setting):

    19200/8-N-1

- Baud rate: 19200 bps
- eight (8) data bits
- no (N) parity bit
- one (1) stop bit


Message Structures
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Each message sent by the terminal follows the structure described in the previous chapter. This chapter specifies the fields included in different kinds of messages, as well as their formats and allowed values. The fields are listed in the order in which they appear in the messages.

In order to see some examples of serialized messages, please refer to the messages included in the _Oiva simulator_ (in the same Git repository as this document).


### Common Formats

#### Timestamps

Times are given in the format `HHmmss` (hours, minutes, seconds).

Example: `170957` for 17:09:57, that is, nine minutes and 57 seconds past five p.m.

#### Currency Amounts

Monetary amounts are formatted:

- as a floating point number
- using `.` as the decimal separator
- with a leading sign (`+` for sales, `-` for cashing, cancellations, and refunds)
- followed by leading padding zeroes, as required in order to reach a total character length of 10

Example: `+000107.08` for 107 Euros and 8 cents.

Identified instant messages
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Identified instant messages consist of one summary message per customer session and associated sell and cancel messages that are linked to the summary message with a SessionID. Elite terminal can be set up to print separate tickets for each identified instant sell. Summary ticket that contains all identified instant sell transactions per customer session is always printed end of session. This summary ticket contains the same SessionID in barcode as is in the summary message. It is up to the implementer to decide whether to utilize the summary feature or handle each sell message separately.

Separate customer ticket is printed for each identified instant cancel and validation (identified and unidentified).
