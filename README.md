# Veikkaus Elite-S – Sales Terminal Transaction Interface for Cash Registers

This repository provides resources for cash register system providers and developers integrating with Veikkaus Elite-S betting terminals.

## Introduction

The data link between the betting terminal and the cash register enables the synchronization of betting transactions between Veikkaus’ gaming systems and retailers’ POS systems. This eliminates the need for manual input at the cash register and reduces discrepancies between Veikkaus invoicing and the retailer’s bookkeeping.  

The Veikkaus Elite-S betting terminal provides the transaction interface for this integration.
